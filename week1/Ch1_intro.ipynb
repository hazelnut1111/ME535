    "We are now well into an era where computer simulations and \"big data\" are essential elements of engineering. In that context, it is more important than ever to not only have an understanding of the basics of numerical methods but also to be able to implement and customize numerical methods as needed. Traditionally there has been a split between compiled languages (like C/C++) that are relatively fast in terms of execution but relatively slow in terms of development and interpreted languages that are relatively slow in terms of execution but relatively fast in terms of development. Computer math systems like Matlab tend to be toward the extreme end of the interpreted range.\n",

    "In this class we will employ python as our language of choice. It is a full-blown, general-purpose programming language suitable for significant programming tasks; it can operate as an interpreted language which supports rapid development; just-in-time compilers are available so that the resulting code can achieve efficiency comparable to compiled languages; it is relatively mature with a large set of available add-on libraries for scientific computing; and it is one of the two leading languages of choice in the data science community.

    "## 1.2 Logic, Loops and Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "In any programming language, implementation of algorithms involves logical control of the execution based on factors such as evaluation count and logical tests of intermediate results. Python offers numerous methods for implementing execution control, but we will be able to go a long way knowing how to use just a couple of them. In particular, we will use `for()` loops for managing evaluation counts and `if-elif-else` structures for managing execution flow based on logical tests. Let's create the python analogs of the sample codes in Section 1.2 to see these statements in action.\n",

    "Rootfinding is the process of identifying values of $x$ for which $f(x)=0$. A continous function that has values with opposite signs at the enpoints of an interval must have a root in the interval (because a continuous function cannot jump from negative to positive without passing through zero). \n",

    "The bisection method of rootfinding leverages that fact to locate roots by isolating them within small intervals. The basic steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Choose a starting interval whose endpoints have function values with opposite signs. (This can be verified in a single statement by checking that the product of the endpoint values is negative.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Compute the value of the function at the midpoint of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Discard the subinterval whose endpoints produce function values with the same sign to obtain an interval half as large as before that still satisfies the sign change criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Go to step 2 and repeat until the termination criterion (typically interval size or function value at midpoint) is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example in the book (with MATLAB code labeled \"bisection.m\") chooses the intial interval $[xl,xr]=[-4,-2.8]$. Let's verify that the function does have opposite signs at the endpoints."

    "In the previous Newton-Raphson example, there were multiple occurrences of the expression $exp(x)-log(x)$. In such cases, it is convenient (and advisable) to define a new function so that recurring expressions can be referred to by name. This approach saves keyboarding, enhances clarity, and makes debugging easier. In this section we consider the example function $f(x)=x^3+sin(x)$. The python syntax given below for defining the function specifies that the name is `myfun` and the desired function value is returned. Note that a `docstring` (accessible using `help(myfun)`) is included to describe the function. __You should build good habits and create docstrings for your functions. Anyone using your code, including \"future you\", will be grateful that you did!__"
